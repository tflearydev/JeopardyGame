<h1>Jeopardy Project</h1>
<br>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Here is my first General Assmebly project. I created a Jeopardy board game that allows multiple players and has questions pertaining to subjects of modern day importance, in which what I feel even the Presidents need to know to further our world.</p>
<p>
<p> Player 1 and Player 2 each choose whether they want to be President Obama or President Trump (our latest 2 Presidents). Then the fun begins! Questions include subjects including electrical vehicles(EV), space exploration, world hunger, healthy foods, and programming languages.</p>
<br>

<h3>Technologies Used</h3>
<ul>
<li>HTML- imported bootstrap, connected javascript and jquery files, styled webpage, created elements for my table and players score, created navigation header</li>
<li>CSS- used bootsrap mostly to style, but normal css to override some</li>
