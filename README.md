<h1>Jeopardy Project</h1>
<br>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Here I created a multi player jeopardy game that pertains to questions of subjects relating to modern day importance: which includes software development questions, electrical & self-driving vehicle questions, world hunger & healthy foods, space exploration, and presidents.</p>
<p>These subjects interest me as I value the importance of providing exponential value to everyday society and furthering the developent of the world. 
<p>
<p> Player 1 and Player 2 each choose whether they want to be President Obama or President Trump (our latest 2 Presidents- having no preference). Then the fun begins! Questions include subjects including electrical vehicles(EV), space exploration, world hunger, healthy foods, and programming languages.</p>

<h3>Technologies Used</h3>
